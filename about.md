### Bio
I'm a machine learning engineer at AiRS, Naver Corp. in Seoul, South Korea.
My research interests are machine learning, reinforcement learning, recommendation system, and natural language processing. 
I'm trying to develop a search query recommendation system served on the LINE(JP) app. Additionally, I'm participating in a news recommendation project provided by the LINE app.

I was a research scientist at Machine Learning Lab., NHN Corp. I worked for this company as a military service replacement(전문연구요원). Working as a researcher, I was involved in the projects developing Go AI(like AlphaGO) and fashion search system. I also studied NLP and Recommendation System.

Previously, I was a student researcher at Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information(KISTI) working on the transformation method for nuclear fusion experimental data analysis.

I received a master degree in Computer Science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST).
